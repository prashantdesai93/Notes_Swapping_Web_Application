		"description": "This book is one of the outcomes of a two-year project called VisMaster CA, a coordination action funded by the European Commission from August 2008 to September 2010. The goal of VisMaster was to join European academic and industrial R&D excellence from several individual disciplines, forming a strong visual analytics research community. An array of thematic working groups was set up by the consortium, which focused on advancing the state of the art in visual analytics. These working groups joined research excellence in the fields of data management, data analysis, spatial-temporal data, and human visual perception research with the wider visualisation research community",
